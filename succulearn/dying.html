<p>Unfortunately, plants die sometimes. Different approaches can be taken depending on what is wrong with your plant. Sometimes it can be saved, but other times it may be beyond saving.</p>

        <h4 class="hgrid">underwatering</h4>
        <p>Although succulents require less water than other plants, they still need water to survive. Underwatering will lead a succulent to dry out. Although watering the plant may help in the earlier stages of dehydration, if underwatered for an extended period of time, the plant will be beyond saving.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="grid-item">
        <h4>overwatering</h4>
        <p>
        Overwatering is one of the most common reasons succulents die. Overwatering your succulent can drown it. If the only cause of your plants decline is overwatering, take it out of its pot and allow the soil to fully dry before watering again. Overwatering can also lead to complications with your plant, such as rot.

        <h4>root rot</h4>
        <p>
        Root rot can occur from overwatering or poor soil drainage. When uprooted, succulents with root rot will have brown or black roots, possibly accompanied by a slimy coating and a foul odour. If root rot is present...
        </p>
        <ul class="grid-item">
        <li>
            at the roots: cut off the infected roots and plant in fresh soil.
        </li>
        <li>
            at the stem: the stem will turn black and spotty, and your plant cannot be saved.
        </li>
        <li>
            at the leaves: leaves will appear pale and mushy, and your plant cannot be saved.
        </li>
        </ul>
    <p>
    However, if rot is present at the stem or leaves, the healthy portion of the plant can be propogated.
    </p>

    <div class="grid-item">
    <h4>crown rot</h4>
    <p>
    Crown rot is caused by soil-borne fungus, and typically occurs due to overwatering. The plant will appear wilted and discoloured. Depending on where the plant is effected, the infected part of the plant can be removed and the plant can be moved to fresh, clean, dry soil. Propogation of the healthy portion of the plant is usually the best option.
    </p>
</div>
<div class="grid-item">
    <h4>cold</h4>
    <p>
      Succulents donâ€™t do well in cold temperatures. If you are keeping your succulents outside and the temperature drops, bring them inside and in a warm environment, such as a kitchen, to allow them to recover.
    </p>
</div>
<div class="grid-item">
<h4>critters</h4>
<p>
    Pests can take up residence on your plant. Switch the soil your plant is in. For any effected spots, or where any kind of pest is visible, dip a q-tip in rubbing alcohol to spot-treat your plant.
