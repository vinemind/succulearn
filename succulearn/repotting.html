<p>
    Your plant will need to be repotted after remaining in the same soil for a couple of years, when it has outgrown its current pot, or when you first bring a plant home. Hereâ€™s how to repot a succulent.
</p>

<h4>What you will need:</h4>

<ul>
    <li>
        succulent/cactus potting soil 
    </li>
    <li>
        proper pot
    </li>
    <li>
        shovel
    </li>
    <li>
        rocks/pebbles
    </li>
    <li>
        gloves
    </li>
</ul>

<ol>
    <li>
        <p>
            Before starting, let the soil dry out. When you are planning on repotting your succulent, do not water your plant beforehand. Allow the soil to dry out until it is no longer moist, but not extremely dry.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            With gloved hands and/or a shovel, gently remove the soil from the base of the plant. The goal is to expose the roots without breaking them. This will help your plant take root in its new pot.

    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Place a layer of large pebbles in the bottom of your pot. If your pot has a drainage hole, run it under water once the pebbles are in to ensure water can properly drain out.

        <p>
            By holding your plant so the base is at least half a centimeter below the rim of the pot, check how much dirt is needed to fill the gap between the bottom of your plug and the bottom of the pot. Set the plant aside and fill the pot up to that point, checking fit as needed. Do not pack down the dirt.

    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Place and hold your plant level in the pot so the plug sits on top of the dirt and in the pot. Fill thhe side gaps around the plug with dirt, ensuring the plant stays center. The dirt should fill up the sides of the pot and a bit above the base of the plant. At this point, start packing down the dirt to ensure your plant is stable. Avoid covering the leaves of your plant with dirt.

    <li>
        <p>
            With additional pebbles of any size, place and press them into the top of the soil. This not only helps your plant look more decorative, but will also help prevent rot.
