<p>
    Propogation is a method of growing a plant from parts of another plant. This is commonly done with succulents: many gardeners do this to extend the life of a dying succulent or to have more plants without buying any. Here’s a guide and some info on succulent propogation.
</p>

<p>
    Before you can propogate a succulent, you need to check the health of your plant. Any unhealthy or wilted part of the plant cannot be used for propogation.
</p>

<h4>Obtaining a cutting</h4>

<p>
    A cutting is a portion of a plant, in this case used for propogation. There are 3 main types of cuttings.
</p>

    </div>
    <div class="grid-item">
        &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp fig. 3: offshoots
    </div>
</div>

<p>
    “Beheading” a plant, or taking a cutting from a head or stem of a succulent, is a good method of propogation for plants with wilted or rotted bases/stems, or for plants that have grown quite tall. Obtaining one of these cuttings requires the use of a sharp, clean blade.
</p>

<p>
    Healthy leaves, or leaves that have fallen off your succulent can be used for propogation. This type of cutting is the least destructive and easiest cutting to obtain.
</p>

<p>
    Offshoots occur naturally in succulents, and typically look like a smaller succulent growing off of the main one. Obtaining one of these cuttings requires the use of a sharp blade.
</p>


<h4>
    Identify the separation point
</h4>

<p>
    The separation point is where the cutting can be safely obtained with the best chance of growing. In the case of obtaining a cutting from a healthy plant, this will also do minimal harm to the host plant.
</p>

    </div>
</div>

<h4> Separating the cutting</h4>

<p>
    Using a sharp blade or your hands (in the caase of a leaf cutting), separate along the identified division.
</p>

    </div>
    <div class="grid-item">
        &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp fig. 3.2: at base, separating roots
    </div>
</div>

<h4>Waiting for callous</h4>
<p>
    Place your cutting in a clean, dry area to callous. The cutting will dry out along the cut point. The callous helps prevent rot aand infection, ass it acts as a barrier between the inner structures of the plant and any foreign bodies. Allow your cutting to callous for at least a week.
</p>

<hr class="mid-line"></hr>

<h4>Growing your cutting</h4>

<p>
    There are two main methods for growing your cutting.
</p>

<p>
    Soil propogation is a method where the cutting is placed on or in soil where it can take root.

</p>

<p>
    Water propogation is a method where the cutting is suspended in water while its roots grow.
</p>

        &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp fig. 2: water propogation
    </div>
</div>

<h4> Set up </h4>

<p>
    Choose a nice sunny spot your cutting can stay for a long period of time and a container.
</p>

<p>
    For soil propogation, any shallow dish of any type that can hold at least 1cm of dirt will do. Fill this dish up with cactus/succulent soil.
</p>

<p>
    For water propogation, any small glass, such as a shot glass, will work. Fill this dish partway up with water and cover with a sheet of plastic wrap. Poke a small hole in the middle that can fit your cutting. The base of the cutting should be able to touch the water when placed in.
</p>

        &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp fig. 2.1: water and plastic wrap
    </div>
</div>

<h4>Placing the cutting</h4>

<p>
    The cutting should have some contact with your medium of choice, and the container should be placed in a sunny spot.
</p>

<p>
    For soil propogation, the cutting should be placed on top of the soil with the callous having direct contact with the soil.
</p>

<p>
    For water propogation, place the cutting in the hole in the plastic wrap. It should be supported and able to touch the water. If the cutting does not have enough support, remove the plastic wrap, place some toothpicks on the rim of the cup, and wrap the plastic wrap again.
</p>

    </div>
</div>

<h4>Watering</h4>

<p>
    The cutting must be watered regularly for optimal growth.
</p>

<p>
    For soil propogation, spray the cutting regularly. Do not let it dry out.
</p>

<p>
    For water propogation, change the water when it is running low.
</p>

<h4>Growth and repotting</h4>

<p>
    Over time, your cutting will grow new offshoots and develop roots. Once it has a substantial amount of roots, it can be removed from its container and potted as a regular succulent.
