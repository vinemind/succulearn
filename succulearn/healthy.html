    <p>
        Your succulent will need 2 things to thrive: sunlight and neglect.
    </p>
    <p>
        Succulents need lots of sunlight and do best in warm environments, and next to sunny windows.
    </p>
    <p>
        The most common cause of death and disease for these plants is over-watering. Succulents retain a lot of moisture and need less water than other house plants. Generally, it is advised to water succulents every 2-4 weeks. If you’re unsure of when to water them, let the soil dry out before watering. I personally water mine once a month and give them enough water for it to exit the drainage hole in my pots— this lets me know that the plant has absorbed enough water.

        Not sure how your plant’s doing? Here’s some general indicators to look for:
    </p>


    <h4>shriveled or deflated leaves</h4>
    <p>
        Needs water.
    </p>


    <h4>waxy or dull appearance of some leaves</h4>
    <p>
        Affected leaves most likely had come into contact with water for extended periods of time. Most succulents do not like water on their leaves, so take care to water the soil and not the plant.
    </p>


    <h4>elongated stem</h4>
    <p>
        Succulents will often elongate or become “leggy” when searching for light. Try moving your plant to a closer light source and rotating it occasionally.
    </p>


    <h4>ballooning or discolouration</h4>
    <p>
        Overwatered, early indication of rot. Let soil dry out fully.
    </p>


    <h4>dull and discoloured</h4>
    <p>
        The plant is likely not getting enough sunlight.
    </p>


    <h4>drooping</h4>
    <p>
        An indicator of over/underwatering. Checked for shriveled or ballooned leaves. Can be an early indicator of a dying plant.</p>
